        <p>Social Good: I would like to be a part of Bits of Good as a way to intertwine my computer science related interests with my passion
        for community service. My Girl Scouts Gold Award project, standing out as my largest community service endeavor, has
        been a truly humbling and rewarding experience. It has not only expanded my network with local homeless shelters,
        Montessoris, hospitals, elementary schools, and medical professionals with whom I have shared my virtual COVID
        education kit, but has supplied me with a new ability to attack community problem solving. I have learned the value of
        persistence in networking, clear and prompt communication skills, and developing empathy and social sensitivity. I’ve
        carried these values of empathy and social sensitivity with me through my other community outreach projects. For the
        past 8 years, I have been helping distribute meals at my local gurudwara’s Sewa, or service, every Sunday. In addition,
        I participate in helping cook over 200 meals every month at the homeless shelter service, where we then pack and
        distribute the meals prepared at the gurudwara to homeless shelters around metro Atlanta. Although I am busier and live
        farther away from home now in college, I still make it a point to return home for the monthly homeless shelter services.
        In coordination with my Girl Scouts project, I utilized basics of JS, HTML, and CSS to create a website to draw
        attention to how the pandemic was hitting pockets of India in May 2021. Luckily, the rapport I built from my Girl Scouts
        network brought promising results and attention from doctors and hospitals in India! What better organization that Bits
        of Good for me to exhibit my networking ability with organizations and nonprofits in the metro Atlanta area with my zeal
        for computer science and how it can make the world a better place (in alignment with the Girl Scouts Promise and Law)!</p>
